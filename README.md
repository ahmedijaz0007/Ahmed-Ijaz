Hi my name is Ahmed Ijaz and I am a Software Engineer (Mobile) with over 2 years of experience in iOS and Flutter framework.

I am working at a Silicon Valley based Finteh Comapny i2c. Working here I have gained valuable experience in working with big teams and in coordination with many departments. Also the domain expereicne of PCI (Payment Card Industry) have added quite in my career.


I started working as iOS developer and for the most part of the my career. But then I got an oppertunity to work on Flutter Farmework. I have to say I was truly amazed by the cross platform capabilities of Flutter and its growth Potiential.
Even though the project ended but continued learning Flutter on my own. I did a course of Flutter and Dart Bootcamp by Dr Anegla Yu. This course was Basic but it was quite good.
Recently I have been working on side projects for the purpose of self learning and also doing an advance Flutter course from Udemy to further improve my skills.
